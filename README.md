# City Explorer

---

## Project Purpose:

This app allows the user to search for any venue (Restaurants , cafes , Gyms , Museums, Entertainment Places , etc...)in the selected region in a specific country.

The map is generated by the Google Maps API.
The list of venues is generated by a call to the Foursquare API Search endpoint.
A second API request is made when a location is clicked to get details about the location, including address, phone, price point, user tip and an image. A link to the location's Foursquare page is provided for more information.

## How to Load the App in Development Mode

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
